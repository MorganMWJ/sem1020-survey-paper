\documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{IEEEtran}

% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   %\graphicspath{{/images/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

% this:

%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").
% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{O}{ne} of the main goals of artificial intelligence (AI) is to produce fully autonomous agents that can learn from experience the optimal behaviour for their environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a framework for such experience-driven learning with the advent of deep learning enabling RL to tackle problems previously intractable.   The Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm was introduced by DeepMind to beat previous state-of-the-art agents at playing Atari 2600. This ignited the field of “Deep Reinforcement Learning”; from then on, growth of the field has been exponential.
\\
Deep RL has achieved great success “a decade ahead of its time”[REF DEEPMIND HOMEPAGE] as AlphaGo [REF] defeated Lee Sedol the 18-time Go world champion with a 4-1 victory in Seoul, South Korea. It was thought impossible due to the vast game-tree complexity of Go \begin{math}10^{360}\end{math} (chess is \begin{math}10^{123}\end{math} for comparison). 
\\
The same authors then developed AlphaZero [REF] that beat each world-champion computer programs in the games of Chess, Shogi and Go.
\\
Pluribus achieved superhuman performance at 6-player no-limit Texas Hold’em when competing against elite human players in a series of matches [REF]. Two of the players being past 1st place winners of the poker world series. This represents a massive milestone for AI as the algorithm deals with a partially observable six-agent environment. Many real-world strategic interactions happen in similar environments.
\\
OpenAI used RL to train a robotic hand to solve a Rubik’s cube then transferring what was learnt in simulation to be done on physical actuators in the real world with amazing results [REF]. 
\\
AlphaStar [REF] achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, reaching top of the league and beating 99.8\% of officially ranked human players.
\\
Video games present an interesting challenge and testbed for Deep RL but they are not the end goal. The vision behind Deep RL is of creating systems that learn and adapt in real world domains.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class

\section{Background}
\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an iterative trail \& error, reward \& punishment process over time. At each time step the RL agent acts upon its environment by taking an action. The environment then provides feedback to the agent in the form of an immediate reward. The goal of reinforcement learning is to train an agent through experience to act upon its environment such that the environment yields the most reward to the agent.

\end{figure}

RL differs to Supervised Learning because the targets for learning change over time as the agent learns from interactions with the environment. This is different from supervised learning where the targets for learning are fixed from the beginning.

\subsubsection{Markov Decision Process}
Reinforcement Learning is traditionally modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) [REF]. A MDP is a sequential decision problem for a fully observable, stochastic environment with a Markovian transition model and additive rewards. It is defined as a set of states, actions, a transition model, a reward function, and an initial state distribution \begin{math}\langle S,A,P(s’|s,a),R(s),\rho_0 \rangle\end{math}. 

\begin{description}[\IEEEsetlabelwidth{$P(s'|s,a)$}\IEEEusemathlabelsep]
\item[$S$] States are the set of environment states. The current state being the state of the environment the agent is currently experiencing.
\item[$A$] Actions are the set of actions the agent can take. At each state only a subset of actions may be available.
\item[$P(s'|s,a)$] Transition model is the probability of successful transition for each state-action pair. In deterministic environments this would be 1 but the general formalism of an MDP includes stochastic environments.
\item[$R(s)$] Reward function is the reward the environment yields to the agent for being in a specific state.
\item[$\rho_0$] Initial state distribution defines the set of states the agent can start in.
\end{description}


At any given time-step  \begin{math}t\end{math}, an agent perceives its state  \begin{math}s_t\end{math} and selects an action \begin{math}a_t\end{math}. The environment responds by giving the agent some reward  \begin{math}r_t\end{math} and transitioning the agent into state  \begin{math}s_{t+1}\end{math} \begin{math}(s')\end{math}. When a terminal state is reached a run of the sequential problem is over. A sequence of states and actions between the initial state and the terminal state is called a trajectory, denoted by  \begin{math}T\end{math}.

Diagram of MDP

It is an assumption of MDPs that all transitions are \textbf{Markovian}, that is, the probability of reaching \begin{math}s'\end{math} from  \begin{math}s\end{math} is entirely dependent on  \begin{math}s\end{math} and not any previous states. This means that the value of the future is independent of the past and can only be decided by the actions taken in the present.

The goal of a RL agent is to act in a way that gets as much reward from the environment as possible. In an MDP the goal of an agent is to maximise the expected total future discounted rewards. If an agent can act in this way it will have solved the MDP. Solving an MDP will solve the reinforcement learning problem.
\begin{equation}
\label{mdp_goal}
\max[\sum\limits_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^tR(s_t)] %NEED EXPECTED SYMBOL HERE
\end{equation}
We say discounted rewards because each intermediate reward is typically discounted by a factor \begin{math}\gamma\end{math}  \begin{math}(0,1]\end{math}. The discount factor describes the preference of an agent for current rewards over future rewards, it is the trade-off between short-term and long-term planning. When  \begin{math}\gamma\end{math} is close to 0 future rewards are viewed as insignificant. When  \begin{math}\gamma\end{math} is close to 1 future rewards are viewed as almost equivalent to current rewards.
\\
Not all Deep RL uses an MDP as a model although most use at least some part of it. This is the difference between model-free and model-based RL algorithms and something that will be detailed later. It is my experience that being able to visualise the problem as an MDP is beneficial to reading the literature.
\subsubsection{Value \& Policy based Solutions}
An MDP can be solved by learning an optimal policy \begin{math}\pi^*\end{math}. A policy is a mapping of states to actions \begin{math}\pi : S \rightarrow A\end{math} that tells our agent what action to take at each step along its trajectory. An optimal policy \begin{math}\pi^*\end{math} is a policy that yields the highest expected value from each state and consequently the highest reward from the MDP.

\begin{equation}
\label{optimal_policy}
\pi_s^* = \max_\pi V^\pi(s)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{state_value_accoridng_to_policy}
V^\pi(s_t) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} \gamma^i r_{t+i}
\end{equation}
Another solution is to calculate the value of each state and use the state values to select an optimal action in each state. The value of each state is defined recursively by the \textbf{Bellman Equation}.

\begin{equation}
\label{bellman_state_utility}
V(s) = R(s) + \gamma\max_{a\in A(s)}\sum\limits_{s'} P(s'|,s,a)V(s')
\end{equation}
Traditional solutions to an MDP would perform value-iteration or policy-iteration. Value-iteration uses a dynamic programming approach in the form of Bellman Updates to converge on the actual values of each state. Policy-iteration repeatedly evaluates and improves a policy. The evaluation calculates the value of each state according to the policy. The improvement calculates a new policy by considering a one-step reward look-ahead that updates each of the state values previously evaluated. Iteration terminates when policy improvement yields no change in state values.
\subsection{Deep Learning}
Deep Reinforcement learning is the application of Deep Learning to the Reinforcement Learning problem. Deep learning is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that is concerned with the use large artificial neural networks \cite{IEEEhowto:lecun}. These deep networks often have many intermediate layers and thousands if not millions of parameters. Application of these networks allows RL to scale to problems that were previously intractable. Settings that have high-dimensional state and action spaces, domains where the input is visually rich or where input is required to be encoded over a long history.
\\
Deep neural networks are used to approximate the solutions to an MDP therefore they approximate either the policy function or the value function. Policy networks typically output as a softmax over actions whereas value networks output a numerical value. There are three options for the value function a deep neural network can approximate.
\begin{itemize}
\item State value function \begin{math}V^\pi(s)\end{math}
\item State-action value function \begin{math}Q^\pi(s,a)\end{math}
\item Advantage function \begin{math}A^\pi(s,a)=Q^\pi(s,a)-V^\pi(s)\end{math}
\end{itemize}
\begin{math}V^\pi(s)\end{math} is the value of being in a state \begin{math}s\end{math} assuming the agent continues to follow policy \begin{math}\pi\end{math}. \begin{math}Q^\pi(s,a)\end{math} is the value of being in a state \begin{math}s\end{math} and taking action \begin{math}a\end{math} assuming the agent continues to follow policy \begin{math}\pi\end{math}. \begin{math}A^\pi(s,a)\end{math} describes how much better it is to take a specific action \begin{math}a\end{math}  in state \begin{math}s\end{math} over other actions assuming the agent keeps acting according to policy \begin{math}\pi\end{math}. This is useful because sometimes we do not need to describe how good an action is in an absolute sense, but only how much better it is than others on average.
\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most common type of neural network used in Deep RL. CNNs compose non-linear modules that transform raw data into more abstract representations that can then be used for classification REF. CNNs are deep-learning methods designed to deal with data in the form of multi-dimensional arrays such as images. CNNs are often called feature extractors in the sense that each convolutional layer will extract higher level (more abstract) features. The first layer perhaps identifying lines and edges, the next layer identifying shapes, and later layers recognising whole objects within an image. 
\\
CNNs are composed of Convolutional layers, Pooling Layers and Fully-Connected Layers (also referred to as dense layers). 
\\
A \textbf{convolutional layer} contains a set of filters (also referred to as neurons or kernels). Each filter is a 3D array with a set width \& height known as the receptive field and a depth equal to the depth of the input. Filters slide or convolve over the input performing local element-wise multiplication and summing the result. This weighted sum is then passed through a non-linearity, typically a ReLU activation function \begin{math}f(x) = max(0,x)\end{math}.  Filters typically shift one unit at a time over the input. Strides can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the output, by shifting more than one unit at a time. After sliding the filters of a convolutional layer over all the locations, the layer produces an output called an activation map or feature map. The output activation maps are then used as input to proceeding layers.
\\
\textbf{Pooling Layers} merge neighbouring features into one. They perform down sampling along the spatial dimensionality of the given input. Pooling layers decrease the dimensionality of the representation and therefore the number of network parameters in later layers. They also make the feature maps more robust to small shifts and distortions of the feature image. This is known as “local translation invariance”. There are multiple types of pooling layers. Min Pooling, Max Pooling and Average Pooling are examples [REF].

\textbf{Fully-Connected Layers} are multi-layer perceptions and perform similar functions found in shallow neural networks. It is the job of the fully-connected layers to classify the output of the preceding convolutional and pooling layers.
\subsubsection{Recurrent Networks}
Recurrent neural networks are also used in deep RL and often trailed as alternative architectures. The Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) algorithm uses a recurrent architecture with DQN to play a partially observable version of Atari. 
\\\\
Recurrent networks are neural networks with memory that specialise in processing sequential data. Output of hidden layers are stored in memory neurons. The memory neurons are passed back to the hidden layer as input for the next item of the input sequence that is feed to the recurrent network.
